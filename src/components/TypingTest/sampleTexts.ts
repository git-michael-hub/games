  "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs. How vexingly quick daft zebras jump! Bright vixens jump; dozy fowl quack. Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow. The five boxing wizards jump quickly.",
  
  "Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. Programming can be done using a variety of computer programming languages, such as JavaScript, Python, and C++. The art of programming lies in learning how to solve problems systematically.",
  
  "Typing speed is measured in words per minute (WPM). Good typists can achieve speeds of over 100 WPM. The average person types between 40 and 60 WPM. Typing without looking at the keyboard is called touch typing. The QWERTY keyboard layout is the most common, despite not being the most efficient.",
  
  "React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was developed by Facebook and is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.",
  
  "The Internet is a global network of computers connected to each other which communicate through a standardized set of protocols. It has revolutionized the way information is shared and created new forms of social interaction. The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services.",
  
  "Climate change is the long-term alteration in Earth's climate and weather patterns. It is caused primarily by human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, which adds heat-trapping gases to Earth's atmosphere. The consequences of climate change include rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and disruptions to ecosystems.",
  
  "Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to natural intelligence displayed by animals including humans. AI applications include advanced web search engines, recommendation systems, human speech recognition, autonomous vehicles, and competitive game-playing software.",
  
  "The human brain is the command center for the human nervous system. It receives signals from the body's sensory organs and outputs information to the muscles. The human brain has the same basic structure as other mammal brains, but is larger in relation to body size than any other brains.",
  
  "Space exploration is the use of astronomy and space technology to explore outer space. Physical exploration of space is conducted both by human spaceflights and by robotic spacecraft. Space exploration has often been used as a proxy competition for geopolitical rivalries such as the Cold War.",
  
  "Democracy is a form of government in which the people have the authority to choose their governing legislation. Who people are and how authority is shared among them are core issues for democratic theory, development and constitution. Some cornerstones of these issues are freedom of assembly and speech, inclusiveness and equality.",
  
  "It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis. Improving by 1 percent isn't particularly notable, but it can be far more meaningful in the long run. If you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you'll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you're done.",
  
  "Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results. If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change.",
  
  "You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. To change your behavior for good, you need to start believing new things about yourself. You need to build identity-based habits. The key to building lasting habits is focusing on creating a new identity first. Your current behaviors are simply a reflection of your current identity.",
  
  "Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity. This is one reason why meaningful change does not require radical change. Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity.",
  
  "All big things come from small beginnings. The seed of every habit is a single, tiny decision. But as that decision is repeated, a habit sprouts and grows stronger. Roots entrench themselves and branches grow. The task of breaking a bad habit is like uprooting a powerful oak within us. And the task of building a good habit is like cultivating a delicate flower one day at a time.",
  
  "The process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps: cue, craving, response, and reward. The cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response, which provides a reward, which satisfies the craving and, ultimately, becomes associated with the cue. Together, these four steps form a neurological feedback loop that ultimately allows you to create automatic habits.",
  
  "The Seven Deadly Sins is a collection of essays written by seven Catalan authors who each explore the history and development of one of Christianity's seven deadly sins. They discuss when the sin was selected and how it is defined. They ponder why a natural human emotion would be regarded as bad.",
  
  "Nothing is excessive, disordered, or immoderate except in relation to a gradation that marks the point where excess begins. As these sins are a Christian concept, the tenets of that religion are focused on. There are also many references to ancient beliefs and the more modern development of humanism.",
  
  "We don't have the obligation to be the best people possible, but to be decent people, good enough people, each in our own way. Key episodes in history are alluded to as markers in how what was considered sinful changed and developed. Philosophical thinking through the ages is analyzed.",
  
  "Being constantly angry can lead to embittered obstinacy, but wrath can also offer strength to say no to degrading commitments or evil collaborations. Desire may be a compulsion but the pursuit of momentary pleasure can come at the expense of deeper, more meaningful relationships.",
  
  "The concept of greed cannot be analyzed objectively, as it and other sins are relative to context. Raising awareness of our basic fallibility at comprehending our cultural past and present is absolutely indispensable so as to avoid making dogmatic fools of ourselves.",
  
  "The essays discuss how the seven deadly sins were selected and adapted from ancient beliefs to make religious dogma more palatable. The adaptation of ancient beliefs to Christian spiritual paradigms constitutes one of the most monumental and successful intellectual efforts ever carried out in the Western World."
